        "a": "Lesser",
        "b": "Equal",
        "c": "Greater",
        "d": "Zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Liquids with high molecular masses usually have stronger intermolecular forces, which increases resistance to flow.",
        "b": "Viscosity differs based on molecular structure; it's not necessarily equal.",
        "c": "Correct. Higher molecular mass often correlates with greater viscosity.",
        "d": "Viscosity is rarely zero for liquids."

      "question": "While determining the viscosity of a liquid with the help of a viscometer, the liquid was sucked with great difficulty. The liquid may be.......",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Glycerin",
        "b": "Ethanol",
        "c": "Water",
        "d": "Acetone"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Glycerin is highly viscous and resists flow.",
        "b": "Ethanol is less viscous and flows more easily.",
        "c": "Water has moderate viscosity.",
        "d": "Acetone is low in viscosity."
